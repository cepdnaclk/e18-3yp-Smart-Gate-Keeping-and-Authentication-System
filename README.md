# e18-3yp-Smart-Gate-Keeping-and-Authentication-System

## Introduction

Based on the proper management and security purposes, authorities of various institutions use different methods like verifying the identity of a person and keeping
records. The system they are using to achieve this may be different. But, there are some instances where we wants to verify the identity of a user very accurately.
One of the examples is examinations. Examinations are conducting in various educational institutions such as schools, universities etc. But we identified some problems
in the existing systems.
It costs time for manually check and verify users accurately.
Violating rules by unauthorized access of people can be preventable.
Keeping records of attendances and store data can be done more efficiently.

So, the motivation of our project is to design a system that can verify the identity of a person/user who registered for the examination/event, keeping a record of their
presence/attendance and also providing administration of relevant institution with manageable records. The system could be used for any institution where they need to
have authorized people to enter/access premises.

We propose to design a gatekeeping system that gets the attendance of the person using a fingerprint scanner(including a keypad and a display screen) and a drop arm gate 
that opens for a correctly verified fingerprint. The system is connected to a management system of the institution. The administration of the institution can view and 
handle data there. The registered users can use the fingerprint scanner. In a situation where the fingerprint scanner cannot detect the fingerprint correctly, the user 
can use the keypad for entering permissions. The registration number will be the key to marking attendance. After scanning the fingerprint or giving the key, the display 
screen will display the relevant details of the user. Then, the gate will open for some time range and the user can pass through the gate. Before and after passing the 
gate, the laser sensors will detect whether the user passed the gate or not. So, with this process, the administration of the institution can see the record of the 
entrance of the user from the website. So, the system will provide a solution for the above problem by reducing the time spent on the process and by accurately verifying 
whether a person is registered or not.
